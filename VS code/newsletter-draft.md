# Fresh Pow Day!
*I'm new to skiing... how can I get started?*

---
Skiing is an artform, truly. Once you're in it, you can't stop. It might take over your life, and that's ok---*let it.* 

It's exciting to try new things! Skiing can be a bit intimidating in the beginning stages with all the gear you need, the travel plans, the accomodations, and the actual skiing part. However, none of that is to discourage you! (Though it might seem otherwise.) Despite all the intricacies that go into skiing, it truly is a labor of love.

To get into skiing, the very first thing you should consider is gear. It might be beneficial to [rent ski gear](https://theskimonster.com/blogs/posts/renting-vs-buying-skis-how-to-decide-what-s-right-for-you#:~:text=Rentals%20are%20usually%20cheaper%20than,skis%20through%20airports%20and%20shuttles) for the first time in case you find the sport isn't for you. 

However, if you're ready to buy, there are a plethora of sites to meet your every need. [Steep and Cheap](https://www.steepandcheap.com/cat/skiing?srsltid=AfmBOop1Nktj6fUNawUVJGMVZWdft-UJvgip9_F3LY_47Sn_cZKvbx39) is a great website that offers quality gear at a discounted price. In a similar vein, second-hand websites such as [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=ski&_sacat=0&_from=R40&_trksid=p4624852.m570.l1313) or [Facebook Marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/sanfrancisco/search?query=ski%20gear) are also good places to look for cheap gear from people near you. 

Of course, you don't *have* to go cheap. If you have the means to buy new gear, here are my reccomendations:
- __Skis:__ Head, Elan, Rossignol, and Nordica are a few notable brands with good variety.
- __Boots:__ Tecnica, Atomic, and Lange offer very sturdy and well-fitting boots. 
    - Out of all your gear, boots are the most important. They should fit *extremely* well because the [way your boot fits determines the quality of your skiing.](https://theskimonster.com/blogs/posts/ski-boot-fitting-how-are-boots-supposed-to-fit?srsltid=AfmBOoopJiFq33xf_AwUvXsnoiqE6E4coh01Pt04TNqRxKnhZMWqAVFp) Don't cheap out on boots if you can help it!
- __Poles:__ Leki poles are generally considered the best poles money can buy.
    - If you stumble upon [poles with curves](https://the-raceplace.com/collections/ski-poles/products/2025-swix-composite-race-ski-pole), those are race poles! For standard skiing, stick to straight poles.
- __Helmets:__ Smith, POC, and Dakine are well-loved helmet brands that offer plenty color and style variety.
- __Goggles:__ Goggles tend to be personal prefenece in terms of style, feel, and look, so a certain brand that works for you might not work for someone else.
    - Some goggles have [removable lenses](https://www.amazon.com/ski-goggles-interchangeable-lens/s?k=ski+goggles+with+interchangeable+lens) dependent on conditions. If it's a brighter day, you can equip a darker lens and vice versa. Clear or lighter lenses are best for night skiing!

Unfortunately there [aren't many ski shops in or around Blacksburg](https://www.google.com/maps/search/ski+shop+near+blacksburg+va/@37.2290194,-80.4386787,14.13z?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI2MDIwOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), so it might be in your best interest to shop online or wait to go back to your hometown if there's a ski shop near there.

Now, where the heck are you going to go? What mountains are beginner friendly? What mountains are even nearby?

The mountain [Winterplace](https://winterplace.com/) is located about an hour from Virginia Tech's campus in West Virginia. Winterplace is  extremely beginner friendly with reasonably low rates as far as skiing goes (this stuff ain't cheap!). Otherwise, there are [numerous other mountains](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/comments/100w7xs/best_place_to_go_skiing/) within a couple hour radius of the Blacksburg area. 

Those are the basics! Don't worry, as you get started, everything will fall into place. Everyone starts somewhere, so don't be discouraged by others around you on the slopes. Go at your own pace, and just have fun!

Here are a few more tips for new skiers to keep in mind:
- **Don’t buy lodge food!** They hike the prices for mediocre food, so you’re better off packing your own lunch.
- Stick to the bunny slope and greens as you’re getting started. It’s better to build your confidence on the easier slopes than send it down something harder and injure yourself.
- Always keep your body forward! If you lean too far back, you’ll lose control and begin skiing in what we call [“the backseat”](https://skiportillo.com/en/stories/5-common-mistakes-intermediate-skiers-make-and-how-to-fix-them/#:~:text=Skiing%20in%20the%20backseat%20essentially,be%20in%20the%20long%20run.).

Happy shredding! :)
